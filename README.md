# STAIR_LIGHT
Configurable Program, designed for RP2040 Microcontrollers. If you want to DIY your own stair lights with sensors to check if somebody is walking up-/downwards and a simple configuration possibility via Bluetooth, this is the go to project :)

## Usage
Take yourself a Microcontroller (Code is written for Waveshare RP2040 Zero) connect the Pins with suiting Resistors to the Components (Bluetooth Module, Lights, Sensors).  
Flash the Code onto the Controller and it should be ready to go.

## TODO
I plan to provide some schematics.
